# openssl-libs

The repository contains a set of OpenSSL's crypto libraries, precompiled for various platforms. The only purpose of this repo is to provide OpenSSL for my **cc7** project. I don't want to store any prebuilt binaries in the cc7.

Project has been moved to [lime-company/openssl-libs](https://github.com/lime-company/openssl-libs)
